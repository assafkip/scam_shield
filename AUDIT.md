â”œâ”€â”€ lib/pages/ (13 files) - Screen implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/models/ (7 files) - Data models (well-structured)
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/services/ (5 files) - Business logic services
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/state/ (3 files) - State management
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/screens/ (3 files) - Training screens
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/utils/ (3 files) - Utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/theme/ (2 files) - Theming and animations
â””â”€â”€ assets/ - JSON scenarios and images
```

### 1.2 Content Assets
- **Scenarios**: 4 JSON files with varying schema consistency
- **Images**: Comprehensive set (badges, companions, UI elements)
- **Youth Content**: 5 specialized scenario files (y01-y05)
- **Research Content**: FBI/FTC based scenarios with victim testimonies

### 1.3 Documentation State
- **Strong**: PRD documentation, QA checklists, roadmaps
- **Missing**: API documentation, component library docs, architecture decision records

## 2. Architecture Assessment

### 2.1 State Management Pattern
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ **MIXED IMPLEMENTATION**

**Current Approach**: Provider pattern with distributed state
```dart
// Found 33 StatefulWidget implementations
// Provider usage: lib/state/app_state.dart
// Local state scattered across components
```

**Issues Identified**:
- No centralized state architecture
- Manual state synchronization between screens
- Inconsistent data flow patterns
- Missing state persistence strategy

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Functional but scales poorly

### 2.2 Conversation Engine Architecture
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL FRAGMENTATION**

**Three Competing Systems Identified**:

1. **Legacy System** (`interactive_chat.dart`)
   - Uses `ConversationMessage`/`ConversationChoice` models
   - Complex state management with Provider
   - Handles classic scenarios

2. **Research System** (`interactive_research_scenario.dart`)
   - ID-based node navigation system
   - Trust calibration integration
   - Uses different JSON schema

3. **Dynamic System** (`dynamic_interactive_chat.dart`)
   - Enhanced scenarios with dynamic responses
   - Separate component architecture

**Architectural Debt**: HIGH
- No unified conversation interface
- Schema inconsistencies across JSON files
- Duplicated chat UI components
- Impossible to share features across systems

### 2.3 Navigation and Routing
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ **BASIC IMPLEMENTATION**

- Manual Navigator.push() patterns throughout
- No named routes or route management
- Deep linking not implemented
- State not preserved across navigation
