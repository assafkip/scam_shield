# Risk Register & Mitigation Strategies

## Executive Risk Summary

Based on the AUDIT.md findings and PRD analysis, ScamShield faces significant architectural, UX, content, and schedule risks during the transformation from current fragmented state to ideal unified platform.

## Risk Categories

### ðŸ”´ Critical Risks (High Impact, High/Medium Likelihood)

#### R001: Architectural Fragmentation Debt
**Source**: AUDIT.md findings - three competing conversation engines
**Likelihood**: High | **Impact**: High | **PRD**: PRD-01
**Description**: Current architectural debt with three separate conversation systems makes unified development extremely difficult and blocks all subsequent improvements.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Start with PRD-01 as absolute priority (P0)
- Incremental migration with backward compatibility adapters
- Extensive testing at each migration step
- Feature flag rollout to limit blast radius
- Dedicated senior engineer assignment

**Success Criteria**: Single conversation engine handles all scenario types without functional regression

---

#### R002: WCAG Accessibility Compliance Gaps
**Source**: AUDIT.md - missing accessibility features
**Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: High | **PRD**: PRD-10
**Description**: Current lack of screen reader support, semantic labels, and contrast compliance excludes users with disabilities and creates legal/ethical risks.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- External accessibility audit early in PRD-10
- Automated contrast checking in CI/CD
- Screen reader testing with actual assistive technology
- Accessibility expert consultation throughout development
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checklist enforcement

**Success Criteria**: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verified by external audit

---

#### R003: User Fatigue with 30-Day Commitment
**Source**: PRD-08 design assumptions
**Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: High | **PRD**: PRD-08
**Description**: 30-day progressive curriculum may be too long for user retention, leading to high dropout rates and reduced training effectiveness.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- 5-minute daily sessions to minimize time commitment
- Flexible scheduling with catch-up options
- Weekly milestone celebrations and progress visibility
- Early user testing to validate commitment level
- Optional accelerated path for motivated users

**Success Criteria**: >60% completion rate for 30-day curriculum in user testing

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risks (Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood)

#### R004: Scenario Content Creation Bottleneck
**Source**: PRD-04 content requirements
**Likelihood**: High | **Impact**: Medium | **PRD**: PRD-04
**Description**: Expanding scenarios to 8-15 message depth with branching requires significant content creation expertise that may not be available internally.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Expert consultation with scam psychology specialists
- Start with existing scenarios and expand incrementally
- Template-based approach for consistent quality
- External content review and validation
- Parallel content creation while building systems

**Success Criteria**: 5 scenarios successfully expanded with expert validation

---

#### R005: Performance Degradation from Feature Complexity
**Source**: Multiple PRDs adding computational complexity
**Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium | **PRD**: Multiple
**Description**: Adding trust calculation, adaptive difficulty, pressure meters, and deep conversations could impact app performance below acceptable thresholds.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Performance benchmarking established early
- Optimization sprints scheduled after each PRD
- Efficient algorithms prioritized over complex ones
- Memory usage monitoring and leak prevention
- Progressive enhancement approach

**Success Criteria**: <200ms conversation loading, 60fps maintained throughout

---

#### R006: Platform Legal Issues from Authentic Skins
**Source**: PRD-05 visual resemblance to real platforms
**Likelihood**: Low | **Impact**: Medium | **PRD**: PRD-05
**Description**: Authentic visual styling may create trademark or copyright issues with platform owners (WhatsApp, Gmail, etc.).

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Educational use disclaimer prominently displayed
- Avoid exact trademark reproduction
- Generic naming and branding where possible
- Legal review before deployment
- Removal/modification plan if challenged

**Success Criteria**: Legal review approval and clear educational use designation

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Lower Risks (Low/Medium Impact, Low/Medium Likelihood)

#### R007: Trust Calculation Accuracy Issues
**Source**: PRD-02 choice-based inference complexity
**Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: Low | **PRD**: PRD-02
**Description**: Inferring trust from choice semantics may not accurately reflect user psychology, reducing educational effectiveness.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- A/B testing against current explicit trust sliders
- Algorithm tuning based on user behavior data
- Expert psychology consultation on calculation logic
- User feedback collection on trust accuracy
- Fallback to explicit input if needed

**Success Criteria**: Trust calculation correlation >80% with expert expectations

---

#### R008: Timer-Induced User Stress
**Source**: PRD-06 meaningful countdown timers
**Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: Low | **PRD**: PRD-06
**Description**: Countdown timers may create excessive stress for some users, potentially causing anxiety or abandonment.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Accessibility option to disable timers
- Clear "this is training" context messaging
- Gentle timer progression (optional â†’ required)
- User testing with stress level monitoring
- Alternative pressure techniques for timer-sensitive users

**Success Criteria**: <10% user reports of excessive stress from timers

---

#### R009: Difficulty Calibration Errors
**Source**: PRD-03 adaptive branching algorithms
**Likelihood**: High | **Impact**: Low | **PRD**: PRD-03
**Description**: Adaptive difficulty algorithms may incorrectly assess user skill level, leading to inappropriate challenge levels.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Conservative difficulty adjustments initially
- Extensive A/B testing with different algorithms
- User feedback collection on difficulty appropriateness
- Manual override options for edge cases
- Gradual algorithm refinement based on data

**Success Criteria**: >80% user satisfaction with difficulty progression
