# Content Style Guide

This document outlines the tone and style for all ScamShield content, especially for new scenario packs.

## Tone

-   **Relatable:** Use language that resonates with the target audience (adults 35+ and younger users). Avoid overly technical jargon.
-   **Non-Lecturing:** The goal is to educate and empower, not to scold or condescend. Maintain a supportive and encouraging tone.
-   **Empathetic:** Acknowledge the difficulty of spotting scams and the emotional impact they can have.
-   **Actionable:** Clearly guide users on what to do (safe choices) and what to avoid (risky choices).
-   **Concise:** Get straight to the point. Scenarios should be "snackable" and debriefs should be clear and to the point.

## Tactic Tags

When designing scenarios and debriefs, explicitly name the manipulation tactics used by scammers. This reinforces learning and helps users categorize scam patterns.

-   **Authority:** Scammers impersonate trusted figures (banks, government, police, employers) to gain compliance.
-   **Urgency/Scarcity:** Creating a false sense of immediate need or limited opportunity to pressure victims into quick decisions.
-   **Social Proof:** Claiming "everyone else is doing it" or showing fake testimonials to create a sense of legitimacy.
-   **Emotion:** Manipulating strong emotions like fear, greed, hope, or love to impair judgment.
-   **Foot-in-the-Door:** Starting with a small, seemingly harmless request to gain compliance, then escalating to larger demands.
-   **Norm Activation:** Appealing to a victim's sense of social obligation, duty, or guilt.

## Scenario Design Principles

-   **Branching Storylines:** Allow players to make choices that lead to different outcomes (safe vs. risky).
-   **Immediate Feedback:** Provide clear feedback after each choice, explaining why it was safe or risky.
-   **Debriefing:** After a scenario, summarize the key learning points and explicitly name the tactics used.
-   **Active Recall Quizzes:** Reinforce learning with short, multiple-choice questions related to the scenario's content and tactics.
