# Graphics Brief: ScamShield MVP 0.3

## Goal
To add lightweight, engaging graphics that support the game's core mechanics (inoculation-based training, progression, rewards) without introducing scope creep.

## Principles
- **Simple & Clear:** Graphics should be easily understandable and not distract from the educational content.
- **Consistent Style:** A cohesive visual language across all assets.
- **Low Fidelity:** Placeholders are flat shapes with labels; final assets should maintain a clean, vector-like aesthetic.
- **Purpose-Driven:** Each graphic serves a specific game design or UX purpose.

## Assets Required

### 1. Companion Mascot
- **Purpose:** A friendly, non-judgmental guide that reacts to player choices and provides emotional feedback.
- **States (4):**
    - **Neutral/Observing:** Default state.
    - **Concerned/Warning:** When a player makes a risky choice.
    - **Pleased/Approving:** When a player makes a safe choice.
    - **Thoughtful/Debriefing:** During debriefs or explanations.
- **Style:** Simple, cartoonish, approachable. Could be an animal or abstract character.

### 2. Badges
- **Purpose:** Visual representation of player progression and achievements.
- **Types:**
    - **Shields (Bronze, Silver, Gold):** Represent overall mastery or completion of scenario sets.
    - **Star:** For completing a specific challenge or achieving a perfect score.
    - **Lock/Unlock:** To indicate locked/unlocked content or achievements.
- **Style:** Clean, iconic, easily recognizable. Could incorporate a subtle gradient or metallic sheen.

### 3. Chat Bubbles
- **Purpose:** To visually differentiate message types within the interactive scenarios.
- **Types:**
    - **Incoming Message:** Standard bubble for messages received by the player.
    - **Outgoing Message:** Standard bubble for messages sent by the player (choices).
    - **Scam Highlight:** Distinctive bubble/style for messages containing scam indicators (e.g., red border, warning icon).
- **Style:** Minimalist, clear distinction between types. Could use color coding or subtle shapes.

### 4. Icons
- **Purpose:** Enhance UI clarity and visual appeal.

    - **App Icon:** Main application icon.

## Next Steps
1.  **Placeholder Generation:** Create simple PNGs (e.g., colored squares with text labels) for all assets listed above.
2.  **Integration:** Implement placeholders into the Flutter app to test layout and flow.
3.  **Design Iteration:** Collaborate with a graphic designer to create final, polished assets based on this brief.
