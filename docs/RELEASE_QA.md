# ScamShield Release QA Checklist

## Pre-Release Testing Protocol

### Automated Testing
**Run before all manual testing**

```bash
# Clean build environment
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Static analysis
flutter analyze

# Unit and widget tests
flutter test

# Build verification
flutter build appbundle --release
flutter build ios --release (if iOS testing)
```

**Results (MVP 0.6):**
- [x] `flutter analyze`: ✅ Clean (0 issues)
- [x] `flutter test`: ✅ 90.9% pass rate (20/22 tests) - 2 edge case failures documented in KNOWN_ISSUES.md
